**[Synapse]** is an open-source AI-powered learning assistant designed to transform passive online courses into an active and personalized learning journey.

---

## üöÄ Vision

Watching hours of video lectures can be a passive experience. It's hard to connect concepts, test your knowledge, and build a structured understanding, especially when learning from multiple platforms like YouTube, Bilibili, and Coursera.

**[Synapse]** aims to solve this by acting as your intelligent learning companion. It ingests educational content and rebuilds it into a structured, interactive format that promotes active learning and deeper comprehension.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* üìö **Automatic Summarization**: Distills key takeaways and core concepts from lengthy video lectures into concise summaries.
* üîó **Knowledge Graph Construction**: Automatically identifies key concepts and their relationships, visualizing them in an intuitive graph to help you see the bigger picture.
* ‚úçÔ∏è **Active Learning Tools**: Generates interactive quizzes, flashcards, and key-term definitions from the course content to actively test your understanding.
* üó∫Ô∏è **Personalized Learning Paths**: (Alpha) Suggests prerequisite knowledge and next steps by connecting concepts across different courses and platforms.

## üîß How It Works

The system follows a simple yet powerful pipeline:

**URL Input** ‚Üí **Content Fetching & Transcription (Whisper)** ‚Üí **Knowledge Extraction & Structuring (LLM)** ‚Üí **Knowledge Graph Storage (Neo4j)** ‚Üí **Interactive Learning Material Generation**

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

* **Backend**: Python 3.9+
* **AI / ML**:
    * Speech-to-Text: OpenAI Whisper
    * Core NLP & Generation: Hugging Face Transformers, LangChain / LlamaIndex
    * * **Database**: Neo4j (for Knowledge Graph)
* **API (Optional)**: FastAPI

## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project locally.

### 1. Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher
- Git
- An account with access to an LLM API (e.g., OpenAI)

### 2. Installation

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)[HaoPan036]/[Synapse].git
cd [Synapse]

# 2. Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
# On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
# On MacOS/Linux: source venv/bin/activate

# 3. Install the required dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4. Set up your environment variables
# Copy the example .env file
cp .env.example .env

# Now, open the .env file and add your API keys
# OPENAI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
# NEO4J_URI="YOUR_NEO4J_URI"
# ...
````

### 3\. Usage

Run the main script with the URL of the course you want to process:

```bash
python main.py --url "[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=your_video_id](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=your_video_id)"
```

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap

We have a lot of ideas for the future\! Here's a glimpse of our roadmap:

  * [ ] Support for more platforms (e.g., local video files, articles)
  * [ ] Enhanced dynamic learning path generation based on user performance
  * [ ] Browser extension for a more integrated experience
  * [ ] User authentication and personalized knowledge base
  * [ ] Improved UI for interacting with the knowledge graph
